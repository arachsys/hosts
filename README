System binaries and config
==========================

Each system has its own top-level directory containing bootloader files, a
kernel image and config, firmware blobs, and any system-specific notes.

The kernel image plus any bootloader binaries and config are in the boot/
subdirectory, matching /boot/ on the host. These files might not be freely
redistributable.

Kernels are compiled from the mainline version identified in the header
comment of 'config', patched by the Arachsys Linux pkg/linux recipe. For
ease-of-comparison, this config file is reduced with 'make savedefconfig'
and must be expanded with 'make olddefconfig' before building the kernel.

Binary firmware needed by the kernel is in the firmware/ subdirectory,
referenced as ../firmware in CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE_DIR. All required blobs
are built into the kernel image with CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE.
